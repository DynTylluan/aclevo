# aclevo.xyz Mirror
I archive A LOT of the Web, and to help me run my archive program, I get [HTTrack Website Copier](https://www.httrack.com/) to mirror a website so that I can have a full public map of the site, from HTML files to images. I did just that for aclevo.xyz, a website that is now offline, on 2019-11-05. So enjoy this dump.

Sorry that I don't have much to say, but I was never apart of the group.
